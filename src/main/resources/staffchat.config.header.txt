   This plugin *requires* DiscordSRV in order to access Discord.
   However, it will work just fine in-game regardless of whether DiscordSRV is installed or not.

   ---

   Installation (Discord Setup):

   - 1) Install this plugin and DiscordSRV
        Get DiscordSRV here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/

   - 2) Add a "staff-chat" channel to DiscordSRV's config
        (in: /plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml)

     EXAMPLE:
     EXAMPLE:    # Channel links from game to Discord
     EXAMPLE:    # Replace the "00000000000" below with your staff channel's ID
     EXAMPLE:    Channels: {"global": "00000000000", "staff-chat": "00000000000"}
     EXAMPLE:    #                                        ^              ^
     EXAMPLE:    #                         All staff chat messages will be sent to this channel.
     EXAMPLE:

     IMPORTANT NOTE:
         The channel's name can be anything on Discord (since DiscordSRV uses its channel ID) ...
         However, it MUST be called "staff-chat" in the config.
         **This is very important!**

   - 3) Restart the server

   - 4) Give staff ranks permission to use the staff chat: 'staffchat.access'

   ---

   This config can be reloaded in-game with: '/managestaffchat reload'
   (Be sure to give yourself permission to manage the staff chat with: 'staffchat.manage')



   *If* PlaceholderAPI is installed, both in-game and discord formats will utilize them.
   That plugin is not required for the placeholders defined below.

   In-Game Placeholders:
       %message%: the chat message
       %name%: player's name
       %nickname%: player's nickname if they have one (falls back to regular name)

   Discord Placeholders:
       %message%: the chat message
       %name%: discord user's name
       %discriminator%: discord user's discriminator (#0000)
       %nickname%: discord user's nickname if they have one (falls back to regular name)

   Hex colors are supported using the &x&R&R&G&G&B&B format.
